    "prediction": "Certainly! You can achieve this by creating a function that finds the first and last occurrence of a specified character in the given string and removes those occurrences. Below is a Python function that implements this logic:\n\n```python\ndef remove_first_and_last_occurrence(s, char):\n    if s.count(char) < 2:  # If there are fewer than 2 occurrences, return the original string\n        return s\n    \n    # Find the first occurrence\n    first_index = s.find(char)\n    # Find the last occurrence\n    last_index = s.rfind(char)\n    \n    # Remove the first occurrence\n    s = s[:first_index] + s[first_index + 1:]\n    \n    # Adjust the last index if it was after the first occurrence\n    if last_index > first_index:\n        last_index -= 1  # The string has been modified, so we need to adjust\n    \n    # Remove the last occurrence\n    s = s[:last_index] + s[last_index + 1:]\n    \n    return s\n\n# Example usage:\nresult = remove_first_and_last_occurrence(\"hello world\", \"o\")\nprint(result)  # Output: \"hell wrld\"\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Count Check**: If the character occurs less than two times in the string, it simply returns the original string since there is nothing to remove.\n2. **Finding Indices**: The function uses `find()` to get the first occurrence and `rfind()` for the last.\n3. **Removing Occurrences**: It constructs a new string without the first and the last occurrences of the character.\n4. **Adjustment**: If the last occurrence is after the first occurrence, we adjust the `last_index` to account for the one-character removal before we remove the last character.\n\nYou can call the function with any string and a character to remove.",
    "evaluation": {
      "is_correct": true,
      "explanation": "The student's solution correctly removes the first and last occurrences of the specified character from the input string. The approach used to find the indices and subsequently remove the characters is appropriate. The logic checks for the occurrence count, effectively preventing alterations when fewer than two characters are found. Adjustment for the last index after modifying the string is also well-implemented, ensuring that no unintended characters are removed. Therefore, the function meets the requirements of the prompt.",
